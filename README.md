## About this Project.

This project started as a hobby project after being away from webdev for a few years. I wanted to use a robust framework such as Laravel and to use a frontend JS framework such as Vue.js
I've been working on and off in my spare time, studying documentation and see if I could build something that would confirm I still have the chops ;)
What this project is and isn't:

- It can be configured to work with any of [API-football.com's](https://www.api-football.com/) endpoints. All major tournaments, even all local leagues. 
- I haven't had the opportunity to develop this project using TDD, though I'm well aware that is the way to go.
- The betting pool feature would allow users to invite their friends and put a wager on the games and final winner, top goalscorer etc.
- As it stands the app is not dynamic or adaptive yet. It is however very scalable and can handle lots of concurrent users and requests.
